  - **Virtual Interviews:**
    - Attend mock interviews through platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io, or LeetCode
    - Focus on explaining your thought process for coding problems
    - Practice behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about yourself", "Why should we hire you?", etc.)

  - **Technical Interviews:**
    - Prepare for data structure and algorithm questions
    - Review important concepts like Time Complexity, Sorting algorithms, and Binary Trees
    - Review ML/DL algorithms for potential theoretical questions

  - **Feedback and Improvement:**
    - After each mock interview, take detailed notes on areas for improvement (both technical and communication)

- **Goal:**
  - Have a professional and ATS-friendly resume and cover letter template ready.
  - Gain confidence in interviews through regular practice.
  - Build up your portfolio with projects and hands-on coding.

    - Engage in discussions, post your projects, and reach out to recruiters

- **Face-to-Face Interviews:**
  - **Technical Rounds:**
    - Revise coding problems, system design interviews, and ML-related concepts
    - Brush up on high-level concepts like Neural Networks, Transformers, and NLP for LLM roles
    - Focus on explaining complex problems clearly and concisely

  - **Behavioral Rounds:**
    - Practice common behavioral interview questions like “Tell me about a time when you worked on a team project” or “How did you handle a challenge?”
    - Show your communication and problem-solving skills during these interviews

  - **Feedback and Fine-Tuning:**
    - After each interview, seek feedback to understand where you can improve
    - Use this feedback to improve both your technical skills and your interview performance

- **Goal:**
  - Land at least 2-3 interview calls by the end of this phase.
  - Continue learning from feedback and iteratively improve your resume, interview responses, and technical knowledge.
  - Begin preparing for negotiation and job offers.
